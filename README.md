Take a paragraph 9 (4-7 sentences) to describe what unit testing is and what its benefits are. pgs 904-912 - 7.5 points

Unit testing is essentially the testing of specific software components to ensure that they are properly working. This testing can save time and money when used early in application development by avoiding massive issues that would otherwise go unnoticed until later stages of development. There are currently two types of testing: manual which has develops go over the code, and auto, which has automated tools to test the code for you. In addition, there are multiple techniques to test in code, some even testing user input and output. Often testing early in application development will result in a productive cycle for the rest of application development.
